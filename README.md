# Case Study: Bellabeat

**Glad you stopped by!**

My name is Tyler and this is my case study on Bellabeat, a smart-device and wellness company focused on women empowerment.

In this case study, I explore how 33 non-Bellabeat users utilize their smart-devices and apply my findings to Bellabeat's portfolio of products.

Then, I give a few recommendations on how Bellabeat could adjust their marketing campaigns to better fit the user base.

Hope you enjoy your stay!
